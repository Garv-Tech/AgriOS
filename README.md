# AgriOS 🌱

AgriOS is an open, modular system designed to modernize agriculture using
data, intelligence, and system-level thinking.

## Vision
To empower farmers with:
- Real-time insights
- Smarter decision systems
- Accessible technology
- Scalable agricultural intelligence

AgriOS is not an app.
It is not a website.
It is a system.

## Core Ideas
- Data-driven farming
- Local + global intelligence
- Modular services
- Human-centered design
- Open experimentation

## Current Status
🚧 Early foundation stage — architecture and core ideas in progress.

## Long-Term Goal
Build an agriculture-first operating system that can:
- Analyze soil, weather, crops
- Assist decision-making
- Scale from village to nation
